Armor is an in-process service container for developers to build reliable and robust java application. Armor enables exported service of apps to be executed in isolated thread context. As a result, different service execution flow does not interfere with each other.  

This README is just a fast "quick start" document.
You can find more detailed documentation at [http://craftcode.io](http://craftcode.io).
